##### [[Maximo Ramos]]
In his book [[../../../Library/Reference Books/Creatures of Philippine Lower Mythology|Creatures of Philippine Lower Mythology]], Ramos attempts a taxonomic classification of these creatures. In the foreword, [[Juan R. Francisco]] writes that this is the first attempt to systematize the identities of the Philippine mythological beings for folklore scholarship. 

It started with his professor [[Dr. Wayland D. Hand]], who guided this student in his attempt to classify the *entire pre-Hispanic Philippine pantheon* for the end goal of determining what an [[../../Lower Mythology/Aswangs|aswang]] is. It is important to note that [[Dr. Wayland D. Hand|Dr. Hand]] was an American Folklorist, so the folklore studies passed down and advised to his students were western, which shows in [[Maximo Ramos|Ramos']] works. He justifies the European categories by arguing its usefulness in relating Philippine folklore to folklore scholarship in the rest of the world. 

He also focused his works on [[../../Lower Mythology/'Main Note|Lower Mythology]] which are "beings which, while in fact having no objective reality, are regarded in folk traditions to actually existent, to be generally maleficent and for a variety of reasons to rank below the creatures of higher mythology (ghosts, ancestral spirits, angels, deities, upper divinities)" ^[[[Dr. Wayland D. Hand]]'s Lectures on the Creatures of Lower Mythology]

His study focused not on the names, but on traits and functions
