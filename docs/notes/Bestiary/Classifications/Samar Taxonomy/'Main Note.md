##### [[Edgar Calabia Samar]]
To my knowledge, [[Edgar Calabia Samar|Samar]]'s book [[../../../Library/Reference Books/Mga Nilalang na Kagila-gilalas|Mga Nilalang na Kagila-gilalas]] is the most recent published taxonomic book on Philippine mythological creatures. It isn't the most recent book on that subject though as [[The Lost Journal of Alejandro Pardo]] and [[The Black Bestiary]] were released in 2022. The main difference is that [[../../../Library/Reference Books/Mga Nilalang na Kagila-gilalas|Mga Nilalang na Kagila-gilalas]] proposes a new classification system, that unlike [[../Ramos Taxonomy/'Main Note|Ramos Taxonomy]], is not grounded on western taxonomy. 

##### 7 Categories by [[Edgar Calabia Samar]]
- ###### [[./Mga Lamanlupa|Mga Lamanlupa]]
	- Lamanlupa can be broken daw to *laman* (content/contained) and *lupa* (land), or "those contained in land".  Also known as Kaibaan in [[Pangasinense]] and Tamyaw in [[Waray]]. They are creatures that live underground, mounds or in trees like the [[Balete]]. They are usually small but some are gigantic in size. They are usually hard to see because they are usually in the forms of [[Spirits]] or [[Elementals]]. 
	- Some believe that the [[Lamanlupa]] are the ones who own the world and all below it, which is why humans made offerings to them during planting and harvest season. 
	- They are not usually hostile, unless they are disturbed or their dwellings are destroyed. This is also the reason why people say "*Tabi tabi po*" (a sort of *excuse me*) whenever they find themselves in wild and unfamiliar places. There are still instances where the [[Lamanlupa|lamanlupa]] purposefully plays with or hurts humans. 
- ###### [[./Mga Aswang|Mga Aswang]]
	- [[Aswang|Aswangs]] are creatures that are commonly in human form, though they can change forms and harm humans when night comes.  Also known as [[Aswang|asbang]] by old Tagalogs. ^[[[../../../Library/Reference Books/Mga Nilalang na Kagila-gilalas|Mga Nilalang na Kagila-gilalas]]]
	- They live as ordinary people- quiet and avoidant. They victimize humans by eating their internal organs, or sucking their blood and bodily fluids.
- ###### [[./Mga Halimaw|Mga Halimaw]]
- ###### [[./Mga Anito|Mga Anito]]
- ###### [[Mga Bayani]]
- ###### [[Mga Diwata]]
- ###### [[Mga Bathala]]

Admittedly, the inclusion of [[Mga Bayani]] and [[Mga Bathala]] threw me off, as they are not what I associate when thinking of "Mythological Creatures" as they belong more to the human and god categories. For the purpose of this bestiary, I will distribute his categories as follows:
