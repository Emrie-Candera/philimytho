Lamanlupa can be broken daw to *laman* (content/contained) and *lupa* (land), or "those contained in land".  Also known as Kaibaan in [[Pangasinense]] and Tamyaw in [[Waray]]

They are creatures that live underground, mounds or in trees like the [[Balete]]. They are usually small but some are gigantic in size. They are usually hard to see because they are usually in the forms of [[Spirits]] or [[Elementals]]. 

Some believe that the [[Lamanlupa|Lamanlupa]] are the ones who own the world and all below it, which is why humans made offerings to them during planting and harvest season. 

They are not usually hostile, unless they are disturbed or their dwellings are destroyed. This is also the reason why people say "*Tabi tabi po*" (a sort of *excuse me*) whenever they find themselves in wild and unfamiliar places. 

There are still instances where the [[Lamanlupa|lamanlupa]] purposefully plays with or hurts humans.
