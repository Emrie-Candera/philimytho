### About 
The [[Alan|Alan]] are deformed [[../Classifications/Samar Taxonomy/Lamanlupa|lamanlupa]] who live in forests or in springs. It hangs upside down on tree branches like bats. 

It has wings as thick as a carabao's skin. Its fingers and toes are facing backwards which makes it look frightening. 

Sometimes, the alan raises a child that came from an unborn baby. Other times, they take newborns. They raise the child in a house made of gold. Once the child finds out their true identity, they leave the [[Alan|Alan]] and returns home to their real parents, bringing along the gold. 

They are considered by the [[Tinguian]] as the lowest form of [[../Classifications/Samar Taxonomy/Lamanlupa|Lamanlupa]] which is why they are mostly the subject of laughter or victims of cheating in rituals.
