### About 
The [[Amalanhig|amalanhig]] is an [[Bestiary/Lower Mythology/Aswang|aswang]] that has died and resurrected. [^1]

They became an [[Bestiary/Lower Mythology/Aswang|aswang]] through consuming a chick. They pass on their being [[Bestiary/Lower Mythology/Aswang|aswang]] to one relative when they're nearing their death. This is done using the chick that they consumed when they first turned. If they fail to pass on that chick, they ressurect as the [[Amalanhig|amalanhig]] and live in the forest. [^1]

The word [[Amalanhig|amalanhig]] literally means "*ang matigas*" (the stiff), because of their hard and stiff feet. [^1]

They attack their victims by biting them in the neck [^1]
