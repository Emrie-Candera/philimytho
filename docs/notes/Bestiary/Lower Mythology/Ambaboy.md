### About 
The [[Ambaboy|Ambaboy]] is a [[Pinading]] (nature guardians) who lives in sacred trees like the [[Sakkang]]. They are usually seen in the form of a giant snake. [^1]

When an [[Igorot]] is sick, they believe it is because he is possesed by the [[Ambaboy|Ambaboy]] or other [[Pinading]]. This is why they offer pigs (baboy) or chickens to them, as well as [[Tapuy]] (an Igorot rice wine), until the [[Ambaboy|ambaboy]] heals the sick [[Igorot]]. [^1]

In other cases, the [[Ifugao]] conduct the [[Umalih]], or calling the soul of the victim in the tree they believe the [[Ambaboy|ambaboy]] resides in. [^1]
