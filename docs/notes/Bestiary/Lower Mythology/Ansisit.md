### About 
They are [[../Classifications/Samar Taxonomy/Lamanlupa|lamanlupa]] who hate the dust from house sweeping. [^1]

Its size ranges from that of a finger to 1 1/2 *dipa* ^[the width from one middle finger to another with two extended arms; around 5.6ft]  [^1]

It lives in a *punso* (mound),  large rocks, or old trees behind houses. [^1]

It exacts revenge upon those who don't excuse themselves by saying "Kayu-kayu, umadayu kayu" (which roughly translates to "you-you, stay away") when they walk across its dwelling. [^1]

Their victims mostly experience swelling of the eyes, lips or legs. [^1]

On the other hand, children can befriend an [[Ansisit|ansisit]]. They usually ask for an [[Ansisit|ansisit]] in finding lost things (like a broom), or even lost pets. [^1]

##### Remedy
- One way to heal an [[Ansisit|ansisit]]'s victim is by calling it at 6o'clock, asking for forgiveness and wiping the swollen area with cotton dipped in the water in *kabibe* (clams/seashells). This is done every night until the swelling is gone. [^1]
