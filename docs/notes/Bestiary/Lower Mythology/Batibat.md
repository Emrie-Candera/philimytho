### About 
The [[Batibat|Batibat]] is a type of [[../Classifications/Samar Taxonomy/Lamanlupa|lamanlupa]] that targets gluttons while they are asleep and alone in their room. 

They are described as a very big woman who appears in people's dreams.

During the dream, the [[Batibat|Batibat]] blocks the door that its victim might plan to escape through. This causes the victim to have nightmares and go crazy. 

The [[Batibat|Batibat]] lives in trees, and does not leave that tree even if it has been cut down. It avenges those who have destroyed its home by sitting on their chest until they can no longer breathe.

##### Surviving Them
- To survive a [[Batibat|batibat]]'s attack, the victim has to bite their own thumb or move their toes. Once the victim survives the [[Batibat|batibat]], he becomes a [[Naluganan]] ^[human possesed by souls of the dead, or by the demon] and gains the power to see [[../Classifications/Samar Taxonomy/Lamanlupa|Lamanlupa]] and other creatures.
