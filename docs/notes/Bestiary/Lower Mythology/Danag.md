The [[./Kiwig|Kiwig]] are believed to have started as heavenly creatures who went to earth to help humans learn agriculture. However, when a human accidentally pricked themselves with bamboo, a [[./Kiwig|danag]] helped the human by sucking the bamboo from the human's finger. Because of that, the [[./Kiwig|danag]] tasted human blood and found it to be sweet. He shares this with the other [[./Kiwig|danag]] and they worked together to suck the blood out of one human. Ever since, the [[./Kiwig|danag]] became [[./Aswangs|aswangs]] who live by consuming blood.  [^1]
