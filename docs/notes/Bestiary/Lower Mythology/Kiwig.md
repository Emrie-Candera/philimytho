A [[Kiwig|Kiwig]] is an [[../Classifications/Samar Taxonomy/Mga Aswang|Mga Aswang]] who lives among humans during the day, but morphs into an animal like a hog or a big cat at night. [^1]

It enters homes to kill humans, especially children who don't stop crying. It bites the victim in the neck before eating them. It also kills pregnant women roaming the streets, especially those with their hair up. [^1]

It is said that one becomes a [[Kiwig|kiwig]] when a human eats something with the [[Kiwig|kiwig]]'s saliva. [^1]

They usually pretend to be street vendors who go to towns with pregnant women to scout [^1]

##### Survival
- The [[Kiwig|kiwig]] is also afraid of the anti-aswang staples such as garlic, salt, vinegar and ash. However, they are most afraid of the [[buntot-pagi]] (stingray tail), because even though they can escape when hit by the [[buntot-pagi]], the marks left behind can be seen in their human form the next day. [^1]
