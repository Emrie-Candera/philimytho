The [[Mambabarang|Mambabarang]] is a person who posseses "barang" or all the evil knowledge in witchraft. [^1]

They have pet insects which they use in their craft. They store their pet beetles (*uwang*), cockroaches (*ipis*), centipedes (*alupihan*) or moths (gamugamo) in a bottle or bamboo biyas, which he feeds with ginger roots. [^1]
When they have someone they wish to punish, they conduct rituals and prayers, before whispering commands to his pets. The pets then visit the victim and enter their bodies through their nose, mouth, ears, butt and any other open holes including wounds. The victim will experience pains corresponding to the entry ways intruded ^[headache for ears, amoranas for butt, balinguyngoy for nose, etc]. [^1]

The ailments cannot be cured by doctors which may cause the victims to go crazy and/or die. The ailing only disappears once the insects exit the victim's body. [^1]

When succesful, the [[Arbularyo|arbularyo]] can make the [[Mambabarang|mambabarang]] experience the pain inflicted upon the victim until the [[Mambabarang|mambabarang]] surrenders and withdraws his pet insects.
