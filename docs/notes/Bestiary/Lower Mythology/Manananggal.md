A [[Manananggal|Manananggal]] is a type of [[../Classifications/Samar Taxonomy/Aswang|Aswang]] that has the ability to halve its body at night during the full moon. They grow wings, fangs and very sharp nails, with legs and feet that look like banana trees  [^1]

During the day, the [[Manananggal|manananggal]] appears as an attractive woman with long hair and light skin. [^1]

##### Characteristics and Behavior
- The upper half of its body flies to the house of its prospective victims. They use their tongues as fine as thread to sip the blood of babies from pregnant women's wombs. [^1]
- The lower half of its body is left on the ground, often among banana trees because its legs and feet look like them. [^1]
- There are also [[Manananggal|manananggals]] who prey from under the roof of old houses which is why they have hunched backs. [^1]
- They usually marry young men that will also be their victims. After they kill the man, they move to towns with many pregnant women to find a new husband and victims.

##### Survival
###### Signs
- One can hear a [[Manananggal|manananggal]] coming by the noise from [[Wakwak|wakwaks]], believed to be a [[Manananggal|manananggal]]'s pets [^1]

###### Defeating them
- Moving or sprinkling ash, vinegar or salt over the lower half of its body will make it impossible for the [[Manananggal|manananggal]] to return to its whole form. [^1]
- [[Manananggal|Manananggals]] are also afraid of knives, flavorings, fire or any sources of light, as well as [[buntot-pagi]] (stingray tail) [^1]
- The easiest way to slay the [[Manananggal|manananggal]] is by stabbing it in the back with the sharpened end of a bamboo [^1]
