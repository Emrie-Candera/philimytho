### About 
The [[Mangkukulam|Mangkukulam]] lives in abandoned houses and are known to be vengeful who causes sickness for their enemies. They usually curse those who have harmed them, intentional or not, sometimes even cursing those who just looked at them wrong. [^1]

They can make a variety of objects appear inside another person's body such as igay, bones, wheat, fish and different insects. They also have the ability to possess their victim's bodies.  [^1]

They do not look straight at other people because it is said that the images in their eyes are noticably upside down. Their pupils are also thin and elongated, like those of a cat's or lizard's when they are exposed to the sun. [^1]

They usually use rag dolls, needles or pins. When they plan to curse an enemy or victim, the doll becomes their symbol and every part of the doll pricked by the pin/needle causes pain to the victim. [^1]
