### About 
The [[Mantiw|Mantiw]] is very thin and as tall as the tallest trees such as palm trees. It has hairy black skin. It often leans against Kapok Trees (cotton trees) while chewing [[Betel nuts|nganga]] or smoking tobacco. 

They are usually not harmful. They live in the forest to avoid humans. However, there are times that it just scares people who linger outside during the night. It roams the baryo and picks up the people they find in the streets, puts them on its shoulder and leaves them on top of a tree.
