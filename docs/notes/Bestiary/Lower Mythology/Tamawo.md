### About 
The [[Tamawo|Tamawo]] is a magical creature who doesn't have a gap between its mouth and nose. It has [[Tigadlum]], which is the power to become invisible. They can also take the form of animals such as dogs or carabaos. [^1]

It lives in forests of trees like the [[Balete|Lonok]] or [[Nunuk]]. It only shows itself to those it wishes to appear to. They can be easily identified because of its unusually large size, with rounded eyes and longer fingers and toes.  [^1]

They are not inherently hostile, although they are quite mischievous. They kidnap kids or beautiful maidens and offer them food. If their captive eats the food, the captive will look like a [[Tamawo|tamawo]]. If they refuse the food, the [[Tamawo|tamawo]] returns the child or maiden to where they were captured from after 3 or 4 days. [^1]
